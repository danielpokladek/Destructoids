# University Year 1 | Semester 2 - Group Project.

This is a repository for my first year group project; this is second semester. I have worked on this with a group (members below),
I have decided to archive it for the purpose of being able to look back at it or continue working on it.

Before adding the project to the portfolio page, some of the code needs to be cleaned up and optimized.
At the moment is a lot of rough code that has been created for the group project, and it can be optimized.
Unity is the game engine used for the project.

**Group Memebers - Daniel Pokladek, Tom Gibbs, Alice Baker, Jordan Marks**
